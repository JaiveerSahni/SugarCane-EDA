# 🍬 Sugarcane Production EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global sugarcane production data. The goal is to uncover patterns, understand key trends, and derive insights about sugarcane yield and production across different countries.

---

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used contains information about:

- **Country**
- **Continent**
- **Production per Person (Kg)**
- **Production in tons**
- **Yield (kg/hectare)**
- **Area harvested (hectares)**

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Visualize production trends globally  
- Analyze relationships between yield, production, and land area  
- Identify top sugarcane-producing countries  
- Suggest insights and possible agricultural implications

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Countries with higher land usage do not always have higher yield efficiency
- Brazil is the leading producer of sugarcane in the world.
- Brazil,India and China account for around 80% of the world's total sugarcane production.
- Guatemala has the highest yield per hectare
- Paraguay has the highest production per person.
- There is a strong positive correlation between area and production.
- Some countries show exceptionally high yield with limited land like Guatemala and Paraguay.
- The South American continent is the leading producer of Sugarcane in the world.

## 📈 Visualizations

The analysis includes:
- Bar plots for top producing countries
- Correlation heatmap
- Pie Charts for Continent Wise Production 
- **Scatter Plot** for comparing yield vs land vs production
- Distribution of yield and land area

All generated visualizations are stored in the `images/` folder.
